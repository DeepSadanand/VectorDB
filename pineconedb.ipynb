With that purpose in mind, the Commissions will use the following basic definitions: \\n \\nProgram Educational Objectives – Program educational objectives are broad statements that \\ndescribe what graduates are expected to attain within a few years of graduation.  Program \\neducational objectives are based on the needs of the program’s constituencies.   \\nStudent Outcomes – Student outcomes describe what students are expected to know and be able \\nto do by the time of graduation.  These relate to the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that \\nstudents acquire as they progress through the program.  \\nAssessment – Assessment is one or more processes that identify, collect, and prepare data to \\nevaluate the attainment of student outcomes. Effective assessment uses relevant direct, indirect, \\nquantitative and qualitative measures as appropriate to the outcome being measured.  \\nAppropriate sampling methods may be used as part of an assessment process.  \\nEvaluation – Evaluation is one or more processes for interpreting the data and evidence \\naccumulated through assessment processes. Evaluation determines the extent to which student \\noutcomes are being attained. Evaluation results in decisions and actions regarding program \\nimprovement. \\n \\nThe criteria for accreditation are in two sections \\nGeneral Criteria – General Criteria apply to all programs accredited by an ABET commission.  Each \\nprogram accredited by an ABET commission must satisfy every Criterion that is in the General Criteria \\nfor that commission. \\nProgram Criteria – The Program Criteria provide discipline-specific accreditation criteria.  Programs \\nmust show that they satisfy all of the specific Program Criteria implied by the program title.  Any \\noverlapping requirements need be satisfied only once. \\n \\n \\n----------------------------- \\n \\nAll programs seeking accreditation from the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET must \\ndemonstrate that they satisfy all of the following General Criteria. \\n \\n \\n2 \\n '),\n",

Students \\nStudent performance must be evaluated.  Student progress must be monitored to foster success in \\nattaining student outcomes, thereby enabling graduates to attain program educational  objectives.  \\nStudents must be advised regarding curriculum and career matters. \\n \\nThe program must have and enforce policies for accepting both new and transfer students, awarding \\nappropriate academic credit for courses taken at other institutions, and awarding appropriate \\nacademic credit for work in lieu of courses taken at the institution.  The program must have and \\nenforce procedures to ensure and document that students who graduate meet all graduation \\nrequirements.  \\n  \\nCriterion 2.  Program Educational Objectives \\nThe program must have published program educational objectives that are consistent with the \\nmission of the institution, the needs of the program’s various constituencies, and these criteria.  \\nThere must be a documented, systematically utilized, and effective process, involving program \\nconstituencies, for the periodic review of these program educational objectives that ensures they \\nremain consistent with the institutional mission, the program’s constituents’ needs, and these criteria. \\n   \\nCriterion 3.  Student Outcomes \\nThe program must have documented student outcomes that prepare graduates to attain the program \\neducational objectives. There must be a documented and effective process for the periodic review \\nand revision of these student outcomes. \\n \\nThe program must enable students to attain, by the time of graduation: \\n(a) An ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the program’s \\nstudent outcomes and to the discipline  \\n(b) An ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements \\nappropriate to its solution  \\n(c) An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, \\nor program to meet desired needs  \\n(d) An ability to function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal  \\n(e) An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities  \\n(f) An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences  \\n(g) An ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, \\nand society  \\n(h) Recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in continuing professional development  \\n(i) An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice.  \\n \\nCriterion 4.  Continuous Improvement \\nThe program must regularly use appropriate, documented processes for assessing and evaluating the \\nextent to which the student outcomes are being attained.  The results of these evaluations must be \\nsystematically utilized as input for the continuous improvement of the program.  Other available \\ninformation may also be used to assist in the continuous improvement of the program. \\n \\n3 \\n '),\n",
